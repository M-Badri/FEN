# TEST DESCRIPTION

This directory contains tests for fluid-structure interaction

## falling_ellipse

A rigid ellipse falling under gravity. Comparisons are made in terms of
center of mass traslation, rotation and velocity.
The test is performed with the Lagrangian solid.

## filament

Flexible filament in a uniform current.

## Pan_Eulerian

Migration of a circular rigid particle in a periodic channel with
the Eulerian IBM.

## Pan_Lagrangian

Migration of a circular rigid particle in a periodic channel with
the Lagrangian IBM.
