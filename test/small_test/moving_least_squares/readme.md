# TEST DESCRIPTION

This directory contains tests for the moving-least-square subrotuines.

## forces

The test assumes a velocity and pressure distribution from which forces can be 
evaluated and then verify the hydrodynamic loads comupation routine.

## interpolation 

The test evaluates convergence order of interpolations subroutine in 2D and 3D.
